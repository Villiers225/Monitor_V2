# Defence Procurement Monitor (UK-focused, GitHub Pages Starter)

This builds a UK-focused monitor that discovers, evaluates and organises **UK defence procurement** articles and renders them on a static dashboard.

**Highlights**
- UK-centric feeds + queries (MOD, DE&S, Defence Committee, RUSI, UK Defence Journal).
- Relevance scoring, tagging (problems & solutions), de-duplication.
- Weekly summary + charts of recurring themes/solutions.
- Works with GitHub Pages: dashboard loads data from `/site` (no server).

**Quick start**
1) Create a public repo and upload this folder.
2) Settings → Pages → *Deploy from branch* → `main` + Folder `/site`.
3) (Optional) Add Actions secrets: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `BING_API_KEY`.
4) Run **Actions → Update data**.
